// Given your friend's unfortunate taste preferences, you decide to split the bill only for non-spicy items. You will pay in full for the spicy dishes.
// Given two ordered arrays, one classifying the dishes as spicy vs.non - spicy and the other listing their prices, write a function that outputs an array where the first element is how much you pay and the second element is how much your friend pays.
